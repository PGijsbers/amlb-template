# amlb-template
A template repository for [AutoML benchmark](https://github.com/openml/automlbenchmark) framework integrations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work in progress. These files are together an integration which successfully installs and runs an `interpretml` model.
> Several functions are ignored (e.g., time and resource constraints, reading of additional parameters).
> These will be added later, once I figure out how to best present the template without information overload.

## Instructions
This repository can function as a start to your framework integration.
It provides a minimal example for integrating an ML framework.
